            <p>
                The position property is used to change the position of an element to something other than its default.
            </p>

            <p>
                Beware: The position property should be used to achieve special effects and should not be used to create a grid layout or fix a broken layout.
            </p>

            <p>
                Below is a summary of position values we will discuss in this class.
            </p>

                            <td>Use the CSS properties top, bottom, left, and right to adjust the position with respect to the parent. By "nearest positioned parent" what we mean is the ancestor element nearest in the hierarchy that has some position property
                                set. (Usually just position:relative)

                                Use the position:relative property, along with top, bottom, left and right to overlap elements. You may also need to use the z-index property to control the overlap order.

            <p>
                Tables are used to display tabular data; that is to say, data that is most easily understood in a table format. They should <em>not</em> be used to create grid layouts, since that violates the separation of style and content.
            </p>

            <p>
                Ironically, you can find an example of a table in the above "Position" section.
